[{"content":"Perplexity and Epiphany For a long time, I felt a little tired and unfair because of my career and life, as well as my emotional experience. In those days, I felt that I was the victim, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand my thoughts, my mood was comforted, and my emotions couldn\u0026rsquo;t be vented. Because I really like it, and I really fell into the quagmire of love, so I really want to get praise and encouragement from the other half. However, eagerness for quick success is always bad, because of my eager character. Once I give my feelings, I want to get corresponding rewards: this is normal in an ordinary contractual relationship, but feelings are definitely not ordinary contracts, or when When you haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out your lover\u0026rsquo;s thoughts, it must not be arbitrarily judged.\nSome new thoughts  Before, when I felt wronged, I used to think like this.   You accuse me because I am late in replying to the news and think I don’t care about you; and I accuse you because you sometimes don’t reply to me at all; you have received grievances before, and you feel very uncomfortable, but backhanded. It hurts me harder, even I just want to hear your thoughts, you will do your own thing while chatting with me, I really don’t know what to do, no matter what the reason, I’ve never been doing other things when you are crying, always single-mindedly, listening to you, but you rarely do this. Most of what you show is nothing but caring. If this goes on, I may be Can\u0026rsquo;t hold it.\n In fact, it is obvious that we are not like this. Both you and I want to be less troublesome to each other, so we often choose to force ourselves to do other things so that we don\u0026rsquo;t always pester each other. However, we are all hungry for each other, so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about what trouble we are causing to our favorite person. We all hope that the other party can respond quickly to the messages we send, the other party can be interested in the things we complain about, and we can share with each other in our daily routines. Therefore, there is no need to entangle with the idea of \u0026ldquo;disturbing\u0026rdquo;. The most important thing is to think about how to stick to the other party, how to quickly reply to the other party\u0026rsquo;s news, how to not worry the other party, and how to make the other party feel that they are valued.\nA proposal In fact, the simplest way is one that both you and I need to pay attention to, that is, you need to reply to each other\u0026rsquo;s messages anyway. If you cannot reply, you also need to inform in advance.\n Every time you didn\u0026rsquo;t reply to me because you were sleeping or because of other things, I would panic very much. I don\u0026rsquo;t understand the reason why you don\u0026rsquo;t reply to the news. This will lead to the accumulation of stress and the occurrence of suspicion. You and I are all victims of this phenomenon. Therefore, no matter what you are doing, it is the most basic courtesy to think about the news of the other party.\n But it is worth noting that everyone has the responsibility to provoke the topic. This job should not be handed over to one person unilaterally, but should be a task of working together, otherwise unpleasant things will happen.\nConcluding remarks I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to worry about these trivial matters, so since you told some of your bad feelings, I took the initiative to take these responsibilities. But it turns out that I can’t solve it alone. I need your strength. Therefore, my dear, I hope you can work hard with me for our common happiness.\nFinally, thank you, Aya, I really like you, I miss you.\nSincerely, SANscope.\n","permalink":"https://sanscope.github.io/posts/lover/","summary":"Perplexity and Epiphany For a long time, I felt a little tired and unfair because of my career and life, as well as my emotional experience.
